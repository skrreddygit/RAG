Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions.
These algorithms learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. 
Machine learning is widely used in various applications, including email filtering, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and image recognition.
